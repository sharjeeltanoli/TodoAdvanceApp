# Specification Quality Checklist: Production Cloud Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec covers 6 user stories across P1 (3 stories) and P2 (3 stories) priorities
- 20 functional requirements defined; all are independently testable
- 10 success criteria defined with specific, measurable targets
- Kafka provider (Redpanda Cloud vs Strimzi) deferred to planning phase — both options noted in Constraints
- Domain/DNS is an external dependency requiring developer action before deployment
- All checklist items pass; spec is ready for `/sp.plan`
